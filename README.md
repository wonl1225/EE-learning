# EE learning log
This repository documents a collaborative and self-directed first-year electrical engineering study,
with a main focus on building intuition for core concepts through small-scale Python simulations and documentation.

The objective is to create simulations that connect theory and observable behaviour(e.g. circuit behaviour, noise, signals).

The project will emphasize:
- Implementing simulations from scratch
- Analyzing results with mathematics
- Maintaining concise documentation

Topics will include:
- Circuit Concepts
- Signals and Systems
- Noise and Filtering
