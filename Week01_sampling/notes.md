# Week 01 - Effect of a sampling rate on signals

## Objective
In this project, we will investigate the effect of how many times a discrete measurable value is captured on signals. Python will be used to simulate the sinousodial graph at different sampling rates.

The sinousodial signal is defined as:
g(t) = cos(2π * fs * t)
, where fs represents signal rate.

The signal will be sampled at 5 different rates:
50 Hz
25 Hz
10 Hz
5 Hz

## Observations
Plotted 4 different graphs with various sampling rates (Manipulated variable). 
5 Hz: linear, but non uniform plots were generated
10 Hz:
