# Week 02 - Numerical Verification and Limitations of Gauss's Law

## Objective
This project's objective is to use numerical simulation to check the validity of gauss's law by computing the electric flux through fixed closed surfaces. This will also investigate the convergence and limitations of numerical integration for arbitrary surfaces using python.

To provide some introduction: 

Gauss's law states that the total electric flux through a closed surface is directly proportional to the enclosed electric charge of the surface.

$$
\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0}
