# Week 02 - Numerical Verification of Gauss's Law Using Surface Integration

## Objective
The objective of this project is to numerically verify Gauss's law by computing the electric flux through differently shaped closed surfaces. The surface integrals will be computed by using discrete area elements \( dA \), and the convergence behaviour from Riemann summation will be investigated with increasing surface resolution through python.

For each simulation, a point charge of 5 pC will be placed within different Gaussian surfaces. According to Gauss's law, the total electric flux through surface enclosing a charge is:

$$
\Phi_E = \frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

For a given charge of 5 pC, the theoratical value of the total electric flux is 564.717 Vm.

4 different scenarios will be examined through this experiment:

- A cube with a point charge at the center

- A cube with a point charge near the surface

- A sphere

- Irregular closed surface
