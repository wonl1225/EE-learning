# Week 02 - Numerical Verification and Resolutions of Gauss's Law

## Objective
This project's objective is to use numerical simulation to check the validity of gauss's law by computing the electric flux through differently shaped closed surfaces. This will be computed by decreasing an arbitrary dA over time in Gauss's law. This will also investigate the convergence of numerical integration for various surfaces using python.

For each simulation, a controlled charge is set to 5 pC. With this we can set up a fixed electric flux.

$$
\Phi_E = \frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

The following simulations should converge to 564.717 Vm

4 scenarios will be covered:

Sphere

Cube

Off centered Sphere

Irregular shape
